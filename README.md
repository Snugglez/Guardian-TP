# Guardian-TP


Allows you to teleport to guardian missions via command

Saving time by not needing to open your map, click the quest, and click the confirm window

`!gut`
`!bleak`
`!eyes`
`!tu`
`!crab`
`!balder`
The commands should be pretty self explanatory

Exclude the "!" if used in /8 or proxy chat channel

Properly added opcode/def to https://github.com/meishuu/tera-data so if the module no longer functions, update tera-data

Only mapped the opcode in na, so if you mapped it in another region look again but now as `C_REQUEST_FIELD_EVENT_TELEPORT` its official packet name
